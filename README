This is the final project for Group 3

db.project is an SQLite3 database file.  It was created using the
soap.sql file and loaded with data from the sample_data.sql file.

If re-created, it must be named db.project or the db_file variable
in userProgram.py must be updated.

The userProgram.py program is fairly straightforward, but for some
option, like deleting a row, the column name must be known.  

For bulk load, the data must be the proper format for the table schema.
We included a sample Office_data.csv file for this.
